# vtta.io is live!

In order to not disrupt the current toolset, there's a new server, a new domain and a new toolchain in development that will make everything like... gorgeous and wonderful! Let's have a look at the features and where we stand:

## Content: Articles, Dev Diaries, you name it: 100%

You will find all new content only on vtta.io, vttassets.com will not receive any updates in that part. Indeed if you find any spelling errors or want to correct my weird english, you can do so: The content part of the webpage is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/VTTAssets/vtta.io). It's easy to write new articles, so if you have any interesting topic, give it a try! Just use the Jitsi article as a template, make sure you have a Gravatar assigned to your email and make a contribution!

## Unlocking your Patreon benefits: 0%

In order to unlock your patreon features in the Chrome extension, you will still need to follow the steps [depicted here](https://www.vttassets.com/chrome-extension) on vttassets.com: This hasn't changed at all. 

But I still invite you to 

- Log into vtta.io
- Connect your Patreon account 
- Connect your Discord account

in order to prepare for the migration in the future and to help me to confirm that these basic and necessary functions do work correctly. You can only test these things so much with three Google test accounts... so it's appreciated!

> You will be informed by Patreon post when the countdown to migrate starts. You will have plenty of time to create the necessary accounts here and to download the new Chrome extension

## New Chrome extension: 0%

Instead of re-using the Chrome extension and Webstore entry, I will develop a brand-new Chrome extension that will work only with vtta.io. This makes it a tad easier for me, too, as we can test the new features and way to import your data into Foundry without cutting of the old way. Once on the webstore, you will find the link to the extension here, as it will not be publicly available while in beta in order to avoid confusions. **Right now, use the old Chrome extension to import your content!**

# So much 0%. Get cracking, lazy bum!
*"I can do that. Work, work."*
